This file defines the module representing the environment.

The environment is the collection of all previously defined procedures, e.g.
the built-in ones, and previously defined symbols. The environment is used
by the interpreter to store and lookup the value of symbols and procedures as

/*! \class Environment
\brief A class representing the interpreter environment.

An instance of Environment allows the interpreter to track previously defined
procedures and definitions, either built-in or defined during execution.

To lookup a symbol use one of the member functions is_exp or is_proc, or if you
do not care about
what the symbol maps to is_known. Depending on the value these member functions
return you can obtain
the mapped-to value using get_exp or get_proc.

To add an symbol to expression mapping use the add_exp member function.
